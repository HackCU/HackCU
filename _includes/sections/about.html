                    <hr>
                    <p class="lead">HackCU was started six years ago by a group of
                        passionate students who wanted to provide other students
                        the time and space to work on projects they don't normally work on
                        through school. Since then we've been committed to fulfilling
                        our mission of bringing you high-quality, inclusive events
                        open to people of all levels of experience.</p>
