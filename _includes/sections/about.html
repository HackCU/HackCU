                            Hackathons are a great way for beginners in technology—from 
                            the workshops to software resources provided by HackCU, we 
                            want first-time hackers to learn and build a project first hand. 
                            This track will assess the best hack created by a team of all 
                            beginner hackers.

                            As crucial as the technology behind a project is, for the best 
                            engagement from users it is necessary to have a good user interface 
                            that not only fits the needs of the user but also enhances their 
                            experience. The track will be judged based on the aesthetic nature 
                            of the project’s user design, as well as how effectively it amplifies 
                            the purpose of the project.

                            been many limitations in doing so due to bias in gender, race, 
                            sexual orientation, etc. This track aims to create a hack that 
                            empowers an underrepresented group of people.
